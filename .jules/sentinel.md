## 2026-08-10 - Replace Insecure Math.random() with randomBytes()
**Vulnerability:** Weak PRNG (`Math.random()`) used for sensitive security tokens (`jti`, `refreshToken`, `familyId`, `kid`).
**Learning:** `Math.random()` is not cryptographically secure and can lead to predictable token generation, making the system vulnerable to token guessing or collision attacks.
**Prevention:** Always use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like `node:crypto` s `randomBytes()` or `randomUUID()` for generating any sensitive security identifier or token.

## 2024-05-18 - React Native Cryptographic Nonce Generation
**Vulnerability:** Weak PRNG (`Math.random()`) used for generating secure nonces in React Native apps, allowing for predictable values.
**Learning:** React Native lacks built-in support for `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID()` without specialized polyfills (like `react-native-get-random-values`), which can lead to silent fallback to `Math.random()`. `globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues()` is generally more robust for mobile environments.
**Prevention:** In React Native, prefer `getRandomValues()` over `randomUUID()`. Always include a fallback for unsupported environments to prevent app crashes while gracefully degrading security.

## 2026-09-17 - Secure Secret Fallback Mechanism
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded encryption keys used for AES-GCM envelope encryption fallback.
**Learning:** Replacing hardcoded secrets in legacy systems can cause data loss if backwards compatibility isn't maintained. It requires a fail-safe state for new writes but a fallback to the old key for reading existing data.
**Prevention:** Inject legacy secrets via environment variables, throw errors for missing secrets on new writes, and gracefully fallback on decryption only.
